### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

- ğŸ”­  Iâ€™m currently working on my PhD in Algorithmic Fairness - I use [EthicML](https://github.com/predictive-analytics-lab/EthicML) for most of my experiments.
- ğŸŒ±  Iâ€™m currently learning about the limits of fair representations.
- ğŸ‘¯  Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on research into fairness / bias problems in machine learning.
- ğŸ¤”  Iâ€™m looking for help with how to be more succinct :sweat_smile:
- ğŸ’¬  Ask me about Fairness, Causal Inference, Bayesian modelling
- ğŸ“«  How to reach me: You're already here!
- ğŸ˜„  Pronouns: he/him
- âš¡  Fun fact: The dress was gold and white, there was no blue and black dress.
